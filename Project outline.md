# Project outline
1. **Determine** different types of rockets engines
2. **Research** each type of rocket engines based on the criteria
3. **Comparative analysis** of each type's strenghts and weaknesses
4. **Simulation and modeling** can use matlab/simulink for dynamic simulations, ANSYS for thermal and structural analysis, Openrocket for flight simulation, and RPA for rocket propulsion analysis
5. **Design and Prototyping** 3d modeling using CAD, material selection based on thermal and structural requirements, component fabrication by 3d printing, CNC machining
6. **Testing and Data collection** Collect data: Thrust output, specific impulse, combustion efficiency, thermal performance, and structural integrity under load
7. **Complete Project** Discuss results of each engine type and finalize report
